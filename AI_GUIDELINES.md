# AI Guidelines

This document provides guidelines for using AI tools when contributing to this repository.

## Purpose

These guidelines help ensure consistent, high-quality contributions when using AI-assisted development tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or other AI coding assistants.

## General Principles

1. **Human Oversight**: Always review and understand AI-generated code before committing
2. **Code Quality**: AI-generated code should meet the same quality standards as human-written code
3. **Security**: Be extra vigilant about security implications in AI-generated code
4. **Testing**: All AI-generated code must be properly tested
5. **Documentation**: Ensure AI-generated code is well-documented and understandable

## Best Practices

### When Using AI Assistants

- **Review Carefully**: Never commit AI-generated code without understanding what it does
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test all AI-generated code paths
- **Verify Dependencies**: Check that any suggested dependencies are necessary and secure
- **Check Licenses**: Ensure AI-generated code doesn't violate any licenses
- **Maintain Context**: Provide sufficient context to AI tools for better suggestions

### Code Review

When reviewing AI-assisted contributions:

- Focus on logic correctness, not just syntax
- Verify that the solution addresses the actual problem
- Check for potential security vulnerabilities
- Ensure code follows project conventions
- Validate that tests are meaningful and comprehensive

### What to Avoid

- **Don't blindly accept suggestions**: Always understand the code
- **Don't skip testing**: AI code needs testing too
- **Don't ignore warnings**: Pay attention to linter and security warnings
- **Don't compromise security**: Be extra careful with authentication, data handling, etc.
- **Don't generate sensitive data**: Never use AI to generate API keys, passwords, etc.

## AI Tool Usage

### Recommended Use Cases

- Code completion and suggestions
- Boilerplate code generation
- Test case generation
- Documentation writing
- Code refactoring suggestions
- Bug fixing assistance

### Proceed with Caution

- Complex algorithms
- Security-critical code
- Database migrations
- Authentication/authorization logic
- Performance-critical sections

## Compliance

- All contributions must comply with the project's license
- Respect copyright and intellectual property
- Follow data privacy regulations
- Adhere to the project's code of conduct

## Questions?

If you're unsure about using AI tools for a particular task, ask the maintainers for guidance.
